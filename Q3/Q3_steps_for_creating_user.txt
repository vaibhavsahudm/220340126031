Q3. Answer

Go to AWS site :

Login account -->

then, go to "IAM : Manage access to AWS resource" IAM Management Console

then, go to access management
then, click on users
then, click on add users
I entered user_name as "dev-iot-31"
Select AWS credential type
click on access key
next, Attach existing policies directly
attach policy named as AmazonEC2FullAccess
then,
add key and value then create the user

IT WILL CREATE THE USER dev-iot-31

This user is allowed to access only services related to EC2 as it is mentioned in question.

I created a user named as dev-iot-31, if it tries to use other services than EC2,
it will permission denied error popup will show in AWS account.

SCREENSHOTS ARE ATTACHED IN THIS FOLDER IT WILL BE EASY TO UNDERSTAND.
